# Sublime Text User Package

This repo is just my sublime text user "package". There's all my config, shortcuts, macros, snippets, color schemes, and my little plugins. Some of them might be just useless, others aren't working, but there some pretty good ones :smile:

## Working plugins

- `python runner`: globaly, run the open `_main.py` file. Look at the code if you want to know a bit more about it.
- `Transform PHP`: Slow when you type php code?

		d this m method i str_index i d var_index = 'so cool'
		press ALT+Z and you get:
		$this->method['str_index'][$var_index] = 'so cool';

- `open file from text`: if you have the text `afilename.py:linenb`, just put your cursor on it, and press `ALT+S` and it opens it for you! :smile:
